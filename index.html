<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>
A long time ago in a land far away there lived a sailor, Ivar Tartar who once returning to land, could only eat food with salmon. Unable to socialize at holidays, he invented a treat that would allow him to mix with mortals. Originally thought insane for his dogfood diet, he proved the skeptics wrong by subsisting off of a diet of salmon cookies and taking a gold medal for backward downhill double-dog dare twister racing. As his only surviving relative, I continue this legacy today by offering his original recipe. Tasty enough for a cat, formulated for humans.</p>
